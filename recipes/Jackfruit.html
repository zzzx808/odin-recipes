        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>For vegans and anyone else who wants an interesting and healthy version of pulled pork. It satisfied the craving of this 9-year vegetarian. You may eat this right away by making a sandwich with coleslaw or however you choose, but it is best to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. Then, reheat it. This is especially important if you do not have a slow cooker and choose to cook it in a skillet instead. </p>
        <h2>Ingrefients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
                <li>Â¼ cup chopped Vidalia onion </li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
                <li>3 pounds young green jackfruit packed in water, drained </li>
                <li>2 cups barbeque sauce, or more to taste </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add jackfruit; cook and stir until lightly browned and relatively free of moisture, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer jackfruit mixture to a slow cooker; cover with barbeque sauce. Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until jackfruit shreds easily with a fork, about 6 hours.</li>
